# database folder structure

``` bash
├── migration # for database migrations
├── query # for database queries
├── repo # for database repositories
└── store # for database store
```

## Things to keep in mind

- migration:
  - Do not use VARCHAR(255), Always use TEXT
  - Do not validate here (check in ('one', 'two', 'three'))
  - Database fields should be snake_case
- query:
  - Do not use VARCHAR(255), Always use TEXT
  - There are some naming conventions
  - if you want to get many users for a query, name the function GetAllEntity
  - if you want to get one single user for a query, name the function GetEntityByID
  - write ID not Id
- repo:
  - This folder is generated by sqlc and should not be modified
- store:
  - Use this folder when you wanna use sqlx and cannot use sqlc
  - Try to use sqlc whenever possible
